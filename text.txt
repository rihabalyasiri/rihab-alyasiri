text: Hi! Iâ€™m Rihab, Iâ€™m self-taught frontend developer/designer with one year of experience and blogger in the field of computer science and programming. As I integrated to this field I felt that Iâ€™m special, because the most of the people do not understand the languages that I write on the computer and that gave me an outstanding feelings in my life. Beside I have a passionate to learn more and more in the IT industry. My experience in web development includes the technologies such as HTML5, CSS, SASS, Bootstrap, MYSQL and more than that. I have already studied Communication Engineering then I started with my second Bachelor in Computer Science after noticing the interesting in programming. In my free time I work on my blogs, the idea of the blogs is to influence on the other to take the chance to learn how to code or helping the other, that they already trying to walk in this long field but they are facing obstacles like we all do.
